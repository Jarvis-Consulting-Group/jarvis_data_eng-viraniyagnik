The system was designed to monitor for suspicious activity on-premises and featured advanced capabilities such as motion detection, temperature and humidity sensing for fire detection, and automatically sends the recorded video to the registered user and stores them on the cloud. Additionally, the system was designed to send real-time alerts to registered user in case of a fire detection within the monitored area.",

The monitoring agent, when installed on each node, automatically collects hardware information and resource usage data from the server and persists it to the PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. Periodically, resource usage is obtained using Crontab, and then the collected data can be manipulated using SQL queries. Implemented Git for version control and used GitHub as the central repository, enabling effective code review and collaboration among team members.",
