summary: As a graduate of Cambrian College's Technical diploma program in Computer Programming - Internet of Things, and R.K. University's Bachelor of Technology degree majoring in Information Technology. I am currently employed as a software and data engineer at Jarvis. During my undergraduate studies, I gained experience as a python developer intern at Nexa Infotech IT Services, where I was responsible for developing both the front-end and back-end of a website, as well as designing and configuring the database. During my technical diploma program, I worked as a peer tutor where I provided individual or small group tutoring to students. Additionally, as a member of the Program Advisor Committee (PAC) at Cambrian College, I represented the student body in the development of courses for junior students. I find pleasure in tackling technical challenges, exploring, and creating new technologies, and developing software for various platforms. I am a mathematical person who likes to play with numbers. I relish the opportunity to interact with people and collaborate with them in a team environment. I am a quick learner and have a strong desire to continuously learn and explore new subjects and ideas.

    description: Developed a Cluster Monitor Agent that allows users to monitor and store hardware specifications and usage data for multiple Linux systems. The monitoring agent, when installed on each node, automatically collects hardware information and resource usage data from the server and persists it to the PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. Periodically, resource usage is obtained using Crontab, and then the collected data can be manipulated using SQL queries. The tools used in this project include bash scripts, PostgreSQL, Docker, Git, GitHub, a Notion scrum board, and remote desktop with Linux CentOS.
