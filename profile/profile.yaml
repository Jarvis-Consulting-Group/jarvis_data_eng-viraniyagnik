# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I have earned both a Technical Diploma in Computer Programming - Internet of Things from Cambrian College and a Bachelor of Technology degree in Information Technology from R.K. University. I am currently working as a software and data engineer at Jarvis Technologies Group Inc., utilizing my expertise to develop efficient and effective software systems. During my technical diploma program, I served as a peer tutor and provided individual or small group tutoring to students. Additionally, as a member of the Program Advisor Committee (PAC) at Cambrian College, I represented the student body and contributed to the development of courses. I find great pleasure in tackling technical challenges, exploring new technologies, and developing software for various platforms. I love exploring complex concepts as I have a strong interest in mathematics and a passion for working with numbers. I enjoy interacting with people and collaborating with them in a team environment. I am capable of rapidly acquiring new knowledge and have a eagerness to learn, always striving to expand my understanding and skillset. I am excited for the challenges and rewards that come with being part of a successful software development team.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Cluster Monitor"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    # The project description allows hiring managers to understand your project and technologies you used(e.g. programming languages, libraries, algorithms, hardware, tools, etc.).
    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a Cluster Monitor Agent that allows users to monitor and store hardware specifications and usage data for multiple Linux systems using bash scripts. The monitoring agent, when installed on each node, automatically collects hardware information and resource usage data from the server and persists it to the PostgreSQL database provisioned using Docker. Periodically, resource usage is obtained using Crontab, and then the collected data can be manipulated using SQL queries. Implemented Git for version control and used GitHub as the central repository, enabling effective code review and collaboration among team members.

    description: 
        -The Java Grep app, implemented with core Java packages, stream API, and lambda functions, utilizes Maven for dependency management and JUnit4 for unit testing, while creating a docker image for deployment, allowing it to replicate the egrep Linux command with recursive option and write matched lines to a file.
        -In JDBC App, utilized Data Access Object and Repository patterns and the Core Java JDBC API with Maven-managed dependencies to perform CRUD operations on an existing dataset within a PostgreSQL database deployed on a Docker container, while testing the application using SLF4J logger and accessing the database from a terminal.
        -The Core Java Twitter App, designed with model-view-controller architecture, utilizes Twitter RESTful API V2 and technologies like Maven, Apache HttpClient, OAuth signpost, and fasterXML Jackson Core for managing tweets through command line interface, and is integrated and unit tested with Mockito and JUnit4, and deployed in a Docker container with Twitter API OAuth keys as environment variables.
